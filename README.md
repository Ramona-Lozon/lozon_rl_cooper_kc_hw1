<p>My name is ramona! i was born in london but grew up in the country. I love all sorts of things but I'm a huge nerd ðŸ¤“ I'm into d&d, Warhammer, video games, history, sci fi/fantasy/horror, punk rock, stoner metal, synthwave and all kinds of music. I love modifying clothing and wearing a lot of spikes and studs.</p>
